Rules:  
The basic rules for Mahjong can be found in http://mahjong.wikidot.com/basic-rules.   
Basically, you need just match your tiles to a certain pattern to win.  
You tiles should include a pair, and any number of chows or pungs.  
We don't have the Kong in our game, and we only have two players. So it's much easier to win.
